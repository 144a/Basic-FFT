# Basic-FFT
Basic Implementation of Cooley-Tukey Algorithm

Currently made only as a demo in processing, the program supports evaluating sets of real numbers that are equidistant from each other, assuming that the length of the set is a power of two. This is not meant to be very quick, morerather it is the foundation for a much more optimized FFT Function that I will write once I understand more about pre generating the twiddle factors and adding more base cases.
